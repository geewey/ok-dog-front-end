## Motivation

- I wanted to learn about machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) and explore the complexity of natural language processing (NLP). Building a chatbot project from scratch provided the best quality of learning in a short amount of time. 
- I wanted to create an universally helpful web application, so I based the MVP features off of the most popular commands given to home devices like Amazon Alexa.
- I wanted the web application to be easily accessible. It was important for the chatbot to be mobile-friendly with an intuitive user flow.
- I wanted the features to be easily scalable. I built the back-end to connect with different external APIs, with the ability to quickly add features.
- I wanted to leverage the power of large tech companies' knowledgebases. It turns out Google Dialogflow is a great entry into the Google Cloud platform.
